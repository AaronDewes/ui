This module is written in TypeScript and provides typings for all the components and composables. You can look at the [source code](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/tree/dev/src/runtime/types) to see all the available types.

You can read more about TypeScript on the official Nuxt documentation.

You can use those types in your own components by importing them from `#ui/types`, for example when defining wrapper components:

```vue
<template>
  <UBreadcrumb :links="links">
    <template #icon="{ link }">
      <UIcon :name="link.icon" />
    </template>
  </UBreadcrumb>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import type { BreadcrumbLink } from '#ui/types'

export interface Props {
  links: BreadcrumbLink[]
}

defineProps<Props>()
</script>
```

You don't have to use TypeScript yourself, but doing so will give you access to prop validation and autocomplete.

We've managed to provide dynamic typings on props such as `color`, `size`, `variant`, etc. based on your custom config. For example, you'll be suggested the `custom` color and the `subtle` variant when using the `Button` component with an `app.config.ts` as such:

```ts [app.config.ts]
export default defineAppConfig({
  ui: {
    button: {
      color: {
        custom: {
          subtle: '...'
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```
