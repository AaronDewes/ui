---

Welcome to Nuxt UI v3 beta! We're thrilled to introduce this major update to our UI library, bringing significant improvements and powerful new features tailored specifically for Nuxt applications.

## What's New in v3?

### Migration from Headless UI to Radix Vue
In v3, we've transitioned from Headless UI to Radix Vue as our core component foundation. This change brings several benefits:

- **Improved Accessibility**: WAI-ARIA compliant components with built-in keyboard navigation and focus management.
- **Enhanced Composability**: Unstyled, primitive components for greater flexibility and customization.
- **Vue and Nuxt Compatibility**: Seamless integration with Vue and Nuxt ecosystems.
- **Consistent API**: Enjoy a more unified and intuitive API across all components.
- **Active Development**: Benefit from ongoing improvements and new features in the Radix Vue ecosystem.

While this change may require some adjustments in your existing code, it significantly enhances the overall quality and capabilities of Nuxt UI.

### Tailwind CSS v4 Integration
Leverage the latest Tailwind CSS features for efficient styling and a streamlined development process.

### Tailwind Variants Support
Create dynamic variants easily, allowing for more expressive and flexible component styling.

### Enhanced TypeScript Support
Enjoy improved type safety and an enhanced developer experience with our Nuxt-specific TypeScript optimizations.

## Why Choose Nuxt UI v3?

Nuxt UI v3 offers several advantages over using Radix Vue or Shadcn-vue directly:

- **Nuxt-Specific Integration**: Seamless compatibility with Nuxt features like auto-imports and server-side rendering.

- **Dark Mode Support**: Built-in, easy-to-implement dark mode for your entire application.
- **Nuxt Ecosystem Alignment**: Regular updates in sync with Nuxt releases, ensuring long-term compatibility.
- **Comprehensive Nuxt Documentation**: Detailed guides and examples specifically for Nuxt developers.

## Upcoming Vue Support

We're excited to announce that in the near future, Nuxt UI v3 will also support Vue applications! This expansion will allow Vue developers to leverage the power and flexibility of Nuxt UI components in their projects, regardless of whether they're using Nuxt or standalone Vue.

Key points about the upcoming Vue support:

- **Seamless Integration**: Use Nuxt UI components in your Vue projects with the same ease as in Nuxt applications.
- **Consistent API**: Enjoy the same intuitive API and component structure across both Vue and Nuxt projects.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Benefit from performance enhancements tailored for Vue applications.

  While `Nuxt UI v3` introduces significant changes, we've aimed to maintain as much compatibility as possible.

  The key differences include the transition from Headless UI to Radix Vue, improved accessibility, enhanced composability, Tailwind CSS v4 integration, and improved TypeScript support. These changes result in more flexible and powerful components with better performance and developer experience.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Will Nuxt UI v3 work with other CSS frameworks besides Tailwind CSS?"}
  While Nuxt UI v3 is optimized for use with Tailwind CSS, the core components based on Radix Vue are unstyled. This means you can potentially use them with other CSS frameworks, although you may need to provide your own styling.

  The upcoming Vue support will allow you to use Nuxt UI components in standalone Vue projects without the Nuxt framework. The core functionality and API of the components will remain the same, but some Nuxt-specific features may not be available in Vue-only projects.
